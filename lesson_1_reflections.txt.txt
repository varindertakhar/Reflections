Using diff to find bugs is useful because it allows you to compare the current file with previous versions to spot any changes/mistakes that have been made.

Having easy access to the entire history of a file makes you a more efficient programmer because it allows you to go back and change anything you want without destroying the main program.

Being able to manually commit helps you organize your files in terms of important or logical changes that make sense for you to go back and fix things easily.

Git allows you to commite multiple files at once because it might make more logical sense to you, as the programmer, to group certain files together.

git log allows you to see the commit history of a file and git diff allows you to compare and contrast between two different commnits of a file.

Using version control makes you more confident because you can go back to a previous commit and make any necessary changes without having an effect on other files.

I want to use git for keeping track of big projects that could potentially require me to go back and debug the program or make preferential changes.
